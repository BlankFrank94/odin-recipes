    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A tasty italian classic pie that can be prepared in minutes!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Store Bought Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Dried Basel</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare pizza dough through step 3. If using store-bought 
            frozen pizza dough, make sure it's thawed.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 
            15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza in the next step. If using 
            a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well. Lightly 
            grease a large baking sheet or pizza pan with 1/2 Tablespoon of 
            olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust 
            extra crunch and flavor.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough: When the homemade dough is ready, punch it down 
            to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half and freeze 
            half the dough for another time—see freezing instructions in the 
            pizza dough recipe. On a lightly floured work surface using lightly 
            floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. 
            Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and 
            flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. If the 
            dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what you're 
            doing, cover it lightly and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, then try again.
             Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to 
             create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the
              rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on a baker's peel 
              dusted with cornmeal. Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean 
              kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you gather the 
              pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Top & bake the pizza: Using your fingers, push dents into the surface
             of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush remaining olive oil all over 
             the dough. Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced 
             mozzarella, the shredded mozzarella, and grated parmesan. Sprinkle
              lightly with basil or Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake for 14-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Remove 
            from the oven.</li>
        <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly
             and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Freezing and
              reheating instructions below.</li>
