    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Popcorn Salt</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat,
             combine the oil and 2 popcorn kernels. Cover the pot
              and wait for the kernels to pop, which might take a
               few minutes. In the meantime, place a large serving
                bowl near the stove so it's ready when you need it.</li>
        <li>Once the kernels pop, turn off the burner, remove the
             pot from the heat and pour in the remaining popcorn 
             kernels. Cover the pot again, and give the pot a 
             little shimmy to distribute the kernels evenly. 
             Let the pot rest for 60 seconds to make sure the 
             oil doesn't get too hot before the kernels are 
             ready to pop.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat back up to medium, put the pot back 
            onto the burner and continue cooking the popcorn, 
            carefully shimmying the pot occasionally to cook 
            the kernels evenly. Once the kernels start popping, 
            tip the lid just a touch to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until the popping sound slows to
             about one pop per every few seconds. (If the 
             popcorn tries to overflow the pot, just tip 
             the upper portion of popcorn into your bowl and 
             return it to the heat.)</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and dump the popcorn into your serving
             bowl. Sprinkle the popcorn with a couple pinches of
              salt, to taste, and any other topping you would like.
               Toss the popcorn and serve immediately, for best 
               flavor and texture. The popcorn will taste good for 
               several hours, though.</li>
    </ol>
