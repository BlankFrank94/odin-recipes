    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A tasty italian classic pie that can be prepared in minutes!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs (at least two)</li>
        <li>Whole Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol></ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a glass mixing bowl and beat them until
             they turn a pale yellow color and you see a lot of bubbles
              on the surface.</li>
        <li>Add the milk to the eggs and season to taste with salt and
             white pepper. Whisk the eggs like crazy. If you're not up
              for that, you can use an electric beater or stand mixer
               with the whisk attachment. Whatever device you use,
                you're trying to beat as much air as possible into
                 the eggs.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat.
             Add the butter and let it melt.</li>
        <li>When the butter in the pan is hot enough to make a drop of
             water hiss, pour in the eggs. Don't stir. Let the eggs cook
              for up to a minute or until the bottom starts to set but
               doesn't brown.</li>
        <li>With a heat-resistant spatula, gently push one edge of the
             egg into the center while tilting the pan to allow the
              still liquid egg to flow in underneath. Repeat with
               the other edges, until the eggs are almost entirely
                set but still look a little wet. (Cook a little
                 further if you prefer dry eggs.)</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and continue gently stirring and
             turning the egg until all the uncooked parts become
              firm. Don't break up the egg, keeping the curds as
               large as possible. If you're adding any cheese, add
                it now.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate when the eggs are set but still 
            moist and soft. Eggs are delicate, so they'll continue
             to cook for a few moments after they're on the plate.
             Serve immediately and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
